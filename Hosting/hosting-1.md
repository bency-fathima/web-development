# Detailed Explanation About Hosting (with Examples)

Hosting is the service that makes your website or application accessible on the Internet. In essence, it involves renting space on a server—a powerful computer that’s connected to the internet—to store your website’s files, databases, and other resources.

## 1. What is Hosting?

- **Definition:** Hosting refers to the infrastructure and services that store your website’s files (HTML, CSS, images, databases, etc.) and deliver them to users when they visit your domain.
- **How It Works:** When someone types in your domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`), the request is routed to the server where your website is hosted, and the server sends the required files back to the user’s browser.

## 2. Types of Hosting

### Shared Hosting
- **Description:** Your website shares a server and its resources (like CPU, RAM, and disk space) with many other websites.
- **Best For:** Small websites, blogs, and startups with low to moderate traffic.
- **Pros & Cons:**  
  - **Pros:** Cost-effective and easy to manage.  
  - **Cons:** Performance issues can arise if other websites on the server consume too many resources.
