# 🌐 Node.js Complete Notes (Beginner → Advanced)

---

## 📌 What is Node.js?
- Node.js is a **JavaScript runtime** built on Chrome’s V8 engine.  
- Lets you run JavaScript **outside the browser** (on servers).  
- Used for **APIs, web servers, and real-time applications**.  

---

## ⚡ Features
- **Fast** → Powered by V8 engine.  
- **Asynchronous** → Non-blocking I/O.  
- **Single-threaded** but can handle thousands of requests.  
- **Cross-platform** → Runs on Windows, Linux, Mac.  
- **NPM** → Largest open-source package ecosystem.  

---

## ✅ Advantages
- Easy to learn for JS developers.  
- Great for APIs and real-time apps.  
- Large community + strong ecosystem.  

### ❌ Limitations
- Not suitable for **CPU-heavy tasks** (e.g., ML, image processing).  
- Single-threaded → heavy tasks may block execution.  

---

## 🏗️ Node.js Architecture
- Based on **Single-threaded Event Loop**.  
- Handles **non-blocking I/O** requests efficiently.  
- Uses **Worker Threa**
