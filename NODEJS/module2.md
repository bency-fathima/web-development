🌐 Node.js Basics
📌 What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 engine.

Lets you run JavaScript outside the browser (on servers).

Used for APIs, web servers, real-time apps.

⚡ Features

Fast → Powered by V8 engine.

Asynchronous → Non-blocking I/O.

Single-threaded but handles many requests.

Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Mac).

NPM → Huge package library.

✅ Advantages

Easy for JS developers.

Good for APIs and real-time apps.

Large community support.

❌ Limitations

Not best for CPU-heavy tasks (e.g., image processing).

Single-threaded → heavy tasks block execution.

🏗️ Node.js Architecture

Event Loop handles requests.

Non-blocking I/O for fast response.

Uses Worker Threads for heavy tasks.

⚙️ Install Node.js & NPM

Download from nodejs.org
.

Install → Choose LTS version.

Verify:

node -v
npm -v

🚀 First Node.js Program
Example 1: Hello World
// app.js
console.log("Hello, Node.js!");


Run:

node app.js

Example 2: Simple Server
// server.js
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end("Hello World from Node.js");
}).listen(3000);

console.log("Server running at http://localhost:3000");


✅ This is the simple version of notes – easy to revise, beginner-friendly.

Perfect 👍 You want the next set of Node.js notes in Markdown format with deep explanations.
Here’s the structured .md content:

📘 Node.js Fundamentals
⚡ Node.js REPL

REPL = Read, Eval, Print, Loop

A built-in interactive shell for Node.js.

Used for quick testing and debugging.

Start REPL
node

REPL Commands

Read → Takes user input.

Eval → Evaluates the input.

Print → Displays result.

Loop → Waits for next command.

Example
> 2 + 3
5
> console.log("Hello")
Hello
undefined

Special Commands

.help → list commands

.exit → exit REPL

.save filename.js → save session to file

.load filename.js → load a file

📦 Node.js Modules

Modules are reusable blocks of code.

Each file in Node.js is a module.

Types:

Built-in Modules (http, fs, path, etc.)

Custom Modules (your own code)

Third-party Modules (installed via npm)

🔧 Built-in Modules

Some commonly used:

fs → File System

http → Create server

os → System info

path → File/dir paths

events → EventEmitter

url → Parse URLs

Example: fs module
const fs = require('fs');

// Write to file
fs.writeFileSync('data.txt', 'Hello Node');

// Read file
const data = fs.readFileSync('data.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);

✍️ Creating Custom Modules

Every file is a module in Node.js.

Example: math.js
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
function sub(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

// Export functions
module.exports = { add, sub };

📥 Importing & Exporting
Import in another file
const math = require('./math');

console.log(math.add(5, 3));  // 8
console.log(math.sub(10, 4)); // 6


module.exports → Used to export

require() → Used to import

📦 NPM (Node Package Manager)

NPM is used to manage packages/libraries.

Comes bundled with Node.js.

Provides access to thousands of open-source modules.

Check NPM version
npm -v

📥 Installing Packages
Local Installation (Project Specific)
npm install express


Installs inside node_modules folder.

Saved in package.json (if --save used or default in npm v5+).

Global Installation (System-wide)
npm install -g nodemon


Available anywhere on your system.

Usually used for CLI tools.

📂 package.json

A metadata file for your project.

Contains info about project and dependencies.

Create package.json
npm init -y

Example package.json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "My first Node.js app",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}


name → project name

version → project version

scripts → custom commands

dependencies → production dependencies

devDependencies → for development only

Run scripts:

npm start

📂 package-lock.json

Auto-generated file by npm.

Records exact versions of installed dependencies.

Ensures consistency across environments.

Why important?

package.json → may allow "^4.18.0" (any 4.x version).

package-lock.json → locks exact "4.18.2".

Prevents bugs caused by version mismatch.

✅ This Markdown covers REPL, Modules, NPM, Installation, package.json, package-lock.json with clear examples.

Do you want me to combine this with the first Node.js basics notes into one big .md file (beginner → advanced in order), or keep them as separate chapters?
