# Implementing Responsiveness Using CSS Media Queries

## Introduction
CSS media queries enable responsive web design by applying different styles depending on the device's screen size, resolution, or other characteristics. This ensures a seamless user experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## 1. What Are Media Queries?
Media queries allow you to apply CSS rules based on specific conditions, such as screen width, height, device type, or orientation.

### Syntax:
```css
@media (condition) {
    /* CSS rules */
}
```

## 2. Basic Media Query for Responsive Design
The following media query applies styles only when the viewport width is **600px or smaller** (commonly used for mobile devices):
```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        background-color: lightgray;
    }
}
```

## 3. Common Breakpoints
Here are commonly used breakpoints for responsive design:
- **Mobile (small screens):** `max-width: 600px`
- **Tablet (medium screens):** `max-width: 768px`
- **Laptop (large screens):** `max-width: 1024px`
- **Desktop (extra-large screens):** `min-width: 1200px`

### Example:
```css
/* Mobile */
@media (max-width: 600px) {
    .container {
        width: 100%;
        padding: 10px;
    }
}

/* Tablet */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        width: 80%;
    }
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .container {
        width: 60%;
    }
}
```

## 4. Media Queries Based on Device Orientation
You can apply styles based on whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode.
```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
    body {
        background-color: lightblue;
    }
}

@media (orientation: landscape) {
    body {
        background-color: lightgreen;
    }
}
```

## 5. Combining Multiple Conditions
You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators:
- **AND (`and`)**: Requires both conditions to be true.
- **OR (`,`)**: Applies if any condition is met.

### Example:
```css
@media (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
    body {
        font-size: 18px;
    }
}
```

## 6. Responsive Typography
Use relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`, `vw`, `vh`) for scalable text sizing.
```css
html {
    font-size: 16px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    html {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}
```

## 7. Testing Media Queries
To test responsiveness:
1. Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`).
2. Click the **Toggle Device Toolbar** (`Ctrl + Shift + M`).
3. Resize the viewport to see media queries in action.

## Conclusion
Using CSS media queries allows for a flexible and responsive web design that adapts to various screen sizes and devices. By leveraging breakpoints, orientation-specific styles, and relative units, you can ensure a seamless user experience across all platforms.
