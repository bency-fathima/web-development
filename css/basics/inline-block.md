# Inline vs Block in CSS

In CSS, the `display` property is used to define how an element should be displayed on the web page. Two common values for this property are `inline` and `block`. They define how elements are positioned and how they interact with other elements on the page.

## Block Elements

A **block-level** element occupies the full width available, creating a new line before and after the element. Block elements start on a new line, and you can set their width, height, padding, margin, etc.

### Example of Block Elements

```html
<div style="display: block;">This is a block element.</div>
<p style="display: block;">This is another block element.</p>
Block Element Characteristics:
Takes up the full width of its parent container.

Starts on a new line (stacked vertically).

You can set width, height, margin, padding, etc.

Block-level elements include:
<div>

<p>

<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.

<form>

Inline Elements
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary and does not start on a new line. It flows alongside other inline elements, and you cannot set their width and height.

Example of Inline Elements
html
Copy
<span style="display: inline;">This is an inline element.</span>
<a style="display: inline;" href="#">This is a link (inline element).</a>
Inline Element Characteristics:
Takes up only as much width as the content inside it.

Does not start on a new line (appears inline with other content).

You cannot set width or height for inline elements, but you can set padding and margin (on left and right).

Inline elements include:
<span>

<a>

<strong>

Inline vs Block Comparison
Property	Inline	Block
Width	Takes up only the width of its content.	Takes up the full width of its parent.
Height	Height cannot be set.	Height can be set.
Margin & Padding	Margin and padding only work on left/right.	Margin and padding work on all sides.
New Line	Does not start on a new line.	Starts on a new line.
Changing Display Property
You can also change the display type of an element using CSS. For example, you can turn a block element into inline or vice versa.

Example:
css
Copy
.block-to-inline {
  display: inline;
}

.inline-to-block {
  display: block;
}
Example HTML:
html
Copy
<div class="block-to-inline">This block is now inline.</div>
<span class="inline-to-block">This inline element is now a block.</span>
This demonstrates how elements can be transformed from one type to another by using the display property.
