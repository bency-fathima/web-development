# CSS `position` Property

The `position` property in CSS specifies how an element is positioned in a document. It plays a crucial role in determining how an element is placed in relation to its normal flow and other elements.

## Syntax

```css
position: static | relative | absolute | fixed | sticky;
1. static (default)
Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

No special positioning is applied.

css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  position: static;
}
‚úÖ Note: top, right, bottom, and left have no effect on static elements.

2. relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position.

You can use top, right, bottom, left to move it.

css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
üìù Note: Space is still reserved for the element in its original position.

3. absolute
The element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static).

If no such ancestor exists, it is placed relative to the <html> element.

css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
üìå Note: The element is removed from the normal document flow.

4. fixed
The element is positioned relative to the browser window (viewport).

It does not move when the page is scrolled.

css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
üéØ Use Case: Sticky headers or floating buttons.

5. sticky
A hybrid of relative and fixed.

The element toggles between relative and fixed depending on scroll position.

css
Copy
Edit
.box {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
üìå Note: It works within the bounds of its container.
