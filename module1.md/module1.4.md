# Learn to Use HTML Tags to Structure Headings and Paragraphs

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction to HTML Tags

HTML tags help structure web pages by defining different types of content. **Headings** and **paragraphs** are fundamental for organizing text-based content.

## ðŸ“Œ Headings in HTML (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)

HTML provides six levels of headings, where `<h1>` is the largest and `<h6>` is the smallest.

### **Example of HTML Headings:**
```html
<h1>Main Heading (Most Important)</h1>
<h2>Subheading</h2>
<h3>Section Title</h3>
<h4>Subsection Title</h4>
<h5>Small Heading</h5>
<h6>Least Important Heading</h6>
```

âœ… **Best Practices for Headings:**
- Use `<h1>` only once per page (main title).
- Follow a **logical order** (`<h2>` after `<h1>`, `<h3>` after `<h2>`, etc.).
- Headings improve **SEO** and **accessibility**.

## ðŸ“Œ Paragraphs in HTML (`<p>`)

The `<p>` tag defines paragraphs, separating text into readable blocks.

### **Example of Paragraph Usage:**
```html
<p>This is a paragraph. It contains text that is displayed as a block.</p>

<p>Another paragraph follows, keeping content structured and easy to read.</p>
```

âœ… **Best Practices for Paragraphs:**
- Each paragraph should focus on **one idea**.
- Use paragraphs to improve **readability**.
- Avoid using `<br>` for spacingâ€”use CSS margins instead.

    <body>
        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>This website is designed to teach you about HTML tags.</p>
        
        <h2>Why Use Headings?</h2>

        <h3>Example Usage</h3>
        <p>HTML headings are essential for structuring content hierarchically.</p>
