Components in React

What Are Components?

Components are the building blocks of a React application. They allow developers to break the UI into reusable, independent pieces, making development more modular and maintainable.

Types of Components

React components can be classified into two main types:

1. Functional Components

Functional components are JavaScript functions that return JSX. They are simpler and recommended for most use cases.Functional components are stateless components.

Example:

function Greeting() {
  return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
}

2. Class Components

Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component. They have a render method that returns JSX.class components are statefull components.

Example:

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}

Conclusion

Components are fundamental to React development, enabling reusable, modular, and maintainable code. Understanding functional components, class components, props, state, and lifecycle methods is key to building efficient React applications.
